## Detail
Every country in Asia is stunning, but Taiwan stands out for a variety of reasons. The locals are friendly and welcoming. Taiwan was named the happiest location in East Asia in March 2019.
While it may be a small island, the never-ending variety of views and exciting things to do here will astound you. Taiwan has something for everyone, with over a hundred mountain peaks above 3,000 meters, over a hundred hot springs strewn across the island, both golden and black-sand beaches, nine national parks, world-class museums, glittering skyscrapers, stunning temples, and an unrivaled number of night markets.



## Here are some of the best ways to spend your time in Taiwan:
1. Night Markers
While there are several five-star international restaurants around the country, the true gastronomes frequent the night markets. They guarantee to keep your stomach satisfied while keeping your money intact.

In Taipei, New Taipei, and Keelung, there are around 30 night markets (and over 70 night markets across Taiwan). If you're not sure which one to go to, have a look at this list of Taiwanese night markets. Shilin, Keelung, and Roahe Street in Taipei are among my personal favorites.

2. Taipei 101
